	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a critical concept in computer science that measures the amount of computational time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the size of the input. It provides a theoretical estimate of the running time, helping to determine how efficient an algorithm is. By analyzing time complexity, developers can predict how an algorithm will scale and perform as input sizes grow, which is essential for optimizing code and ensuring efficient execution. Understanding time complexity allows for the comparison of different algorithms and the selection of the most suitable one for a given problem, leading to better resource utilization and performance.</p>
	<p><b>Space complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm requires relative to the size of the input data. It quantifies the storage space needed for variables, data structures, and function calls during the execution of an algorithm. An algorithm with space complexity of \(O(n)\) means that the memory required grows linearly with the size of the input. Understanding space complexity is essential for optimizing programs to ensure they run efficiently within the constraints of available memory, especially for large datasets or memory-constrained environments. By analyzing space complexity, developers can make informed decisions about the trade-offs between memory usage and performance.</p>
